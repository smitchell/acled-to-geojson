ACLED to GeoJSON Utility
========================

This project contains a utility to convert CSV files download from
ACLED [Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project](http://www.acelddata.com/) into a Feature GeoJson.
It is very primitive, just enough to output the file

I could easily have simply build the GeoJSON as a string, but I'm trying to learn more about GeoTools.
The GeoTools Feature and FeatureCollection classes/interfaces are more suited to reading GeoJson
from a database.
